**Objectives:**

1.   Train different session (contextual, sequential) based product recommendation recommenders for E-commerce use cases and compare the performances of the recommenders.

2.   Include item and/or user features as side information for cold items/users.

**Methodology:**

We have adapted the source code to enable the inclusion of item properties/features. Thus, we compute cross-entropy logits when using only item numbers (original) and only item features/properties (addition). Following prof Ma's recommendation, we incorporate both cross-entropy logits by computing a weighted average of the two and introducing a new hyper-parameter lambda (`lam`) that acts as the weight. Lambda takes values from 0 to 1. `lam=0` means that only the original item numbers are included. `lam=1` on the contrary means that only the new item features are included. Values in between are a weighted average of the two.
